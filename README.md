# Motate
Music notation rendering engine optimized for interactive applications. Motate achieves high re-render performance by rendering measures independently. This enables high re-render performance, as individual measures re-render only if needed. 

Motate is built off of [VexFlow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow).
